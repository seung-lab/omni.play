Depersonalizng a very personal undertaking that is authoring code:

This is difficult with a code base like this,
so for now, respect the code that is there up until you have to tear it out and
replace it with "the omni way" of doing what the code was trying to do
in the first place.

mSomethingMemberVariableOfSome class i think, basically its a global to the class. The view2d code has a tone of mDepth vars that are local to the function, which is probably adding to the confusion. Those are just wrong.
