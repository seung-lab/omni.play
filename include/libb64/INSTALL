libb64: Base64 Encoding/Decoding Routines
======================================

Requirements:
------------
This piece of software has minimal requirements. I have tested it on a Linux
machine, with the following specs, both hard and soft:
	* FedoraCore 4
	* kernel v. 2.6.11 (stock FC4 kernel)
	* gcc version 4.0.1 20050727 (Red Hat 4.0.1-5)
	* glibc-2.3.5-10
	* make v. 3.80
	* some arb version of makedepend

I have, as yet, not tested it on a Windows machine. But barring any serious
screwups on my part, this should compile and run sweetly under Cygwin too.
If you DO get it running under some weird arch/os setup, send me a 
mail, please.

Compiling:
---------
There is no configure. It would be overkill for something so simple...
Run make in the root directory.

Installing:
----------
Since the current targets are standalone executables and a static library
(fancy name for archive), an install script has not been implemented yet.
Simply copy the executabled into your path, and use them.

peace out
