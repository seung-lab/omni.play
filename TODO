- test: store turn off (crash) and get the data back later
- manager expose stats
- locking (sort of done in the storage), to be done in the manager
- erasing

- more stats for the storage server:
  - num of bytes read/written
  - average time per request (read/write)
  - etc...

Next step:
- revovery procedure (manager asking the storage servers for the keys)
- manager should use regular memory
- stress test
- multi_get

TODO (for aleks)
- Makefile
