nvidia driver installation blew away mesa-common-dev's
/usr/include/GL/glext.h.

The easiest way to fix is:
Force the mesa-common-dev package back onto the machine overwriting nvidia's
brain damaged one. (I know this works on ubuntu.)

so we need someone w/ sudo to

apt-get install --reinstall mesa-common-dev
