\section md_mainpage Benefits of documentation 

The benefits of using documentation include: easier reuse of old designs, better communication about requirements, more useful design 
reviews, easier integration of separately written modules, more effective code inspection, more effective testing, and 
more efficient corrections and improvements. 

Documentation keeps software-quality at high levels.

\subsection md_mainpage_requirements Requirements

Requirements documentation is the description of what a particular software does or shall do. It is also used as an agreement or as the foundation for agreement on what the software shall do.

\subsection md_mainpage_architecture Architecture/Design documentation

Architecture documentation (also known as software architecture description) is a special breed of design document. Very little in the architecture documents is specific to the code itself,  but instead merely lays out the general requirements that would motivate the existence of such specific code. A good architecture document is short on details but thick on explanation. It may suggest approaches for lower level design, but leave the actual exploration trade studies to other documents.

\subsection md_mainpage_technical Technical documentation

When creating software, code alone is insufficient. There must be text along with it to describe various aspects of its intended operation.It is important for the code documents to be thorough, but not so verbose that it becomes difficult to maintain them.
The idea of auto-generating documentation (Doxygen in this case) is attractive to programmers for various reasons. For example, because it is extracted from the source code itself (through comments), the programmer can write it while referring to the code, and use the same tools used to create the source code to make the documentation. This makes it much easier to keep the documentation up-to-date.

\subsection md_mainpage_user User documentation

Typically, the user documentation describes each feature of the program, and assists the user in realizing these features. A good user document can also go so far as to provide thorough troubleshooting assistance. It is very important for user documents to not be confusing, and for them to be up to date.

\subsection md_mainpage_release Release Notes

Every product has new features and functions, system requirements, and installation instructions that users should be aware of. The best way to communicate the information is with Release Notes.
